            <p style="text-shadow: 5px 5px 5px black; color: white; font-weight: 400;">Manga Mania is an ongoing open
                source author/artist oriented website, our founder/CEO Homer Wilson knows exactly what it's like having
                a dream without any idea on how to achieve it. That's exactly why he came up with the idea for this
                website. We dont want your money, we dont sell, copyright, or steal your content. What you post is
                YOURS. We want to give asipiring authors the chance to grow their fanbase, and have a platform to
                express themselves. We have rules to oblige by here though, so let me state them. <br> <br>
            <h3 style="margin:55px 0 25px 0 ;" class="section-title h2 text-center">Rules And Conditions</h3>
            <p style="text-shadow: 5px 5px 5px black; color: white; font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-family: 'Gajraj One', cursive;
                color: rgb(255 , 0, 200);
                text-shadow: 5px 3px 5px black;">1. NO SMUT: </span> This website is for manga, we know there is a
                certain
                niche crowd for that stuff, but not here. Ecchi
                is allowed but only to a certain level, nudity can be in your manga if it serves purpose to the story,
                flat out hentai will get your content rejected from being posted. We dont shame creative content, we
                know everyone is different, it's just once we go down that rabbit hole there is no coming back from it.
                If you're confused and have no Idea what im talking about, please ignore this and stay innocent.
                Seriously dont look it up. <br><br>
                <span style="font-family: 'Gajraj One', cursive;
                color: rgb(255 , 0, 200);
                text-shadow: 5px 3px 5px black;">2. NO RACISM OR POLITICAL EXTREMISM: </span> Sigh, I hate I have to
                say this, I hate this even more than I hated having to explain the last rule (and I cringed the whole
                time while
                typing that). We dont want your hatred, your extreme political views, and downright ignorance on this
                website. We've had idiots trying to submit manga with offensive caricatures and it wont be tolerated or
                accepted here. This site is for everyone, we dont care about your appearance, oreintation, ethnicity,
                etc. We just want your manga. By all means you're entitled to your beliefs, but so are we, and we
                believe idiots who project their hate into their work should find solace elsewhere. <br> <br>
                <span style="font-family: 'Gajraj One', cursive;
                color: rgb(255 , 0, 200);
                text-shadow: 5px 3px 5px black;">1. DUDE, DONT STEAL:</span> Look we know creativity can be hard to
                channel, but we don't condone theft. Your creative spark will come, we promise. Rather than taking the
                easy way out, and posting something that isn't yours (which will get you permanetly banned btw) just
                wait for your moment to shine, keep posting, keep learning, and eventually you'll have your moment.
            </p>


            <p style="text-shadow: 5px 5px 5px black; color: white; font-weight: 400;"> If you follow these rules, it's
                happy sailing, like i've said before we want this website to be for all manga lovers of all backgrounds,
                just try to be respectful. Real life can be boring, dont bring earth problems to the manga world. Create
                something new. Take your readers to another world and give them the chance to escape their reality
                to a new one. </p>


            <h3 style="margin: 65px 0 25px 0;" class="section-title h2 text-center">How To Get Your Content Published</h3>

            <p style="text-shadow: 5px 5px 5px black; color: white; font-weight: 400;">You're probably wondering what
                i've been babbling about this whole time, I haven't even given you directions on how to post (I know i'm
                the worst), well hold your horses muchachos, muchachas, and others i'm going to explain that to you
                right
                now.</p>
            <p style="text-shadow: 5px 5px 5px black; color: white; font-weight: 400;">Like i've said before, this
                website is fairly new. We don't really trust giving users the ability to post their own content to the
                archive just yet. We're not saying you, the reader, would go against TOS, but there are those who will
                go out of their way to. Until we have a proper auto moderator and proper filth filters set up, we're
                gonna do things the old fashion way (feel free to reread that last statement in a southern accent, it
                adds a bit of gusto). Fill out the form below and give us your information, wait for us to to respond to
                your email, and attach your work in pdf form. Once your content has been looked over and approved you
                will get a email notfying you its been posted to the site, as well as a link to your contents page. It's
                a bit of a slow process at the moment because we're just starting but we promise we'll get it posted for
                you, just be patient :) <br> Also, feel free to check out our latest community posts in our read page. </p> <br><br>
