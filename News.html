        <p style="text-shadow: 5px 5px 5px black; color: white; font-weight: 400;">Manga Mania has been in the works for
          more than 4 years. Founder and creater of the website "Homer Simpson"
          first had the idea when it was suggested to him in the popular subreddit <span
            style="color: rgb(4, 104, 255);">"r</span>/stories" to make a website to
          house his short stories, and bring them to life. It was in the works for years, with minimal progress being
          made every here and there. It wasnt until Homer's Girlfriend (now wife) Mara pushed him to finish his website,
          and make his dream of being a manga author come true.
          <br><br> Fast foward 2 and a half years, and a lot has changed. Homer originally started this website to house
          his
          short stories turned manga, until he had an idea. Knowing the struggle of trying to become a popular author
          and
          the small window of oppurtunity, he decided to make the website for all insiring authors to give them a chance
          to publish their work and gain a fanbase.
          With more than 3000 visitors on day one launch, and now over 25,000 visitors every 2 weeks things can get
          pretty busy. With the support from his friends and fans from <span
            style="color: rgb(4, 104, 255);">"r</span>/stories" Homer had a popular website, but he needed a team that's
          where we came along. A website like this needs a team, the Manga Mania Team is everygrowing with many
          positions, ranging from fellow developers, fellow authors to read stories and make sure they abide the TOS,
          and many more the team is shaping up to look really good. We're happy to finally be up and running and we'll
          work to make sure this website is up to standards for all our users, check here every friday for weekly
          updates and upcoming events and competitons. <br> <br> Thank you for using our website and we hope your visit
          is
          everthing you imagined, whether your're here to read, publish, or apply to join the team we hope we can keep
          you happy.

          <p style="text-shadow: 5px 5px 5px black; color: white; font-weight: 400;">"It was like time stopped when I
            first saw her, I didn't know how to respond to the initial shock, all I saw was this angel walking towards
            me with her hand extended out to greet me. I'm not one for believing in love at first sight, and you'd
            probabally role your eyes if I told you thats what it was; it was. Mara has been the greatest thing to
            ever happen to me in my entire life, and I never thought that I would ever have the courage to ask her out,
            let
            alone someday end up married to her. I remember the day I finally got the courage to ask her out, my friends
            from reddit encouraged and motivated me through the night, I remember how fast my heart was beating, its a
            miracle that I wasnt sweating; I asked her and to my surprise was met with the response "it's about time, I
            didn't want to rush you but I was getting ready to jusk ask you myself". If you told me two years ago that I
            would be married to Mara and that I would have my website not only finished and published, but successfully
            getting my stories out there, I would called you crazy. Well here I am, living it and I still cant beleive
            it." <br>
